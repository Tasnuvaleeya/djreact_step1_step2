Please [post questions on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask). You can open issues with questions, as long you add a link to your Stack Overflow question.\n 2. For bug reports and feature requests, open issues. :bug:\n 3. For direct and quick help from me, you can [use Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/johnnyb). :rocket:\n\n\n## :memo: Documentation\n\n\n### `oneByOne(arr, cb)`\nCalls functions one by one and memorizes the results.\n\n#### Params\n- **Array** `arr`: An array of functions getting the callback parameter in the first argument and response arguments from the previous function call.\n- **Function** `cb`: The callback function called with an error (or `null`) and the results array.\n\n#### Return\n- **oneByOne** The `oneByOne` function.\n\n\n\n## :yum: How to contribute\nHave an idea? Found a bug? See [how to contribute][contributing].\n\n\n## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects\n\nI open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,\nthis takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).\n\nHowever, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:\n\n - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:\n - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal.
